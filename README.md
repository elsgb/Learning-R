# R Workshops

This repository is a clearing house for resources for individual R workshops from [Research Computing Services](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/). 

# Workshops

## Current Workshops


[Intro to R](https://github.com/nuitrcs/r-intro-summer2019)

[`ggplot2`](https://github.com/nuitrcs/r_ggplot_july2018)

[Databases](https://github.com/nuitrcs/databases_workshop/tree/master/r): Information on how to connect to databases from R is part of the databases workshop materials, which also covers the basics of SQL.  The example code there may be a useful reference, but you'll need a database connection to run it.  See that repository for more details.  

[R Markdown](https://github.com/nuitrcs/rmarkdown_workshop)

[R Shiny](https://github.com/nuitrcs/rshiny)


# Software

For workshops, it's best to install R and RStudio on your own laptop (both are free).

[Install R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

[Install RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

If you do not have administrator privileges on your work computer, either work with the relevant IT department to get R and RStudio installed, or use a different laptop for the workshop.

If, for some reason you can't install R and RStudio, consider using [RStudio Cloud](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/user-services/quest/index.html).

See [Software Installation](https://sites.northwestern.edu/summerworkshops/resources/software-installation/) for more details.

# R Resources

## Reference Materials

[RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are short pdfs that summarize key R functions on specific topics. Many people print them out for reference while working in R.  The `ggplot` cheat sheet, in particular, in indispensable.  

[R Reference Card](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Baggott-refcard-v2.pdf): lists many commonly used functions


## Tutorials/Online Courses

[RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers): interactive documents with videos, exercises, and explanations

[RStudio Learning](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/): a list of resources from RStudio

[Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/): Swirl courses run interactively directly in R.  There courses teach both statistical concepts and R together.  See the Swirl website for instructions on installing and using the package. 

[Data Analysis and Visualization using R](http://varianceexplained.org/RData/): an online course from David Robinson, whose [blog](http://varianceexplained.org/) is also worth following.

[OnePageR](https://togaware.com/onepager/): Series of tutorials and sometimes book chapters on using R for data science.  Emphasis here is on machine learning models, but there's lots of useful info for people using R for other purposes as well.

[UBC Stat 545: Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](http://stat545.com/): includes exercises (homework) if you're looking to practice your skills more 

## Books

[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a book available online. It is written by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, who work at RStudio and wrote many of the popular R packages for data manipulation. There's a [welcoming online community](https://medium.com/@kierisi/r4ds-the-next-iteration-d51e0a1b0b82) of folks working on material from this book.

[An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R](http://moderndive.com/index.html) by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim: learn data science and statistics concepts along with R

The [Use R!](http://www.springer.com/series/6991?detailsPage=titles) series of books are available online through the Northwestern library. Search the [library catalog](http://search.library.northwestern.edu) for the title you're interested in, then follow the links in the search result to gain access to the online version of the book.  The series has a few titles about general skills, but many additional domain-specific titles.  Pay attention to the publication date, as occasionally information may be outdated (although usually still a good reference). 

[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, for when you're ready to take the next step.  Much of the material here you won't need when just doing routine analysis with R, but it's essential material if you're trying to really understand how R works.

## Others' Workshops

Materials from other workshops.  These resources often include materials for both instructors and students.  They are often good resources if you're learning on your own as well though too.

[Harvard IQSS Workshops](http://dss.iq.harvard.edu/workshop-materials): Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Data Science Services has their workshop materials online.

[Software Carpentry: R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/): provides a good introduction to R. The materials are meant for teaching an in-person workshop, but you can work through them on your own as well.

## R for Users of Other Statistical Programs

If you're coming to R from Stata, SPSS, SAS, Matlab, or Python, the following resources might be useful to you. Some of them may be a little outdated, but each contains some tables of equivalent commands across programs that might help you get familiar with R more quickly.

[R/Stata Comparison](http://www.princeton.edu/~otorres/RStata.pdf) from Princeton's Data & Statistical Services

[R for SAS and SPSS Users](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4mP5kf41BrmYkxkdmdRdWFibDA/view) is an early, condensed version of a book by the same name, from Bob Muenchen of <a href="https://www.r4stats.com">r4stats.com</a>

[The Tidynomicon: R for Python Programmers](https://gvwilson.github.io/tidynomicon/) by Greg Wilson; may be helpful for those coming to R from other C-derived programming languages as well.

[Matlab/NumPy (Python)/R Commands Chart](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-python-xref.pdf): from Vidar Bronken Gundersen; this one is about 10 years old, but it mostly covers basic commands, which haven't changed

[haven Package](http://haven.tidyverse.org/): for importing Stata, SAS, and SPSS data into R.


## Statistics and Machine Learning

Many of the resources above include statistical components.  In addition, the resources below have a particular focus on statistics.

[UCLA's Statistics Consulting Group](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/dae/) has a great set of tutorials showing how to conduct many types of ANOVA and regression analysis in various statistical packages, including R.  Highly recommended; check here first.

## Visualization

See the [`ggplot` workshop](https://github.com/nuitrcs/ggplotworkshop) for additional resources too.

[R Graph Gallery](http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/): gives examples of visualizations produced in R and the code needed to produce them.  This is a great way to learn how to implement specific plotting features you're looking for or how to make certain kinds of plots.

[Flowing Data](http://flowingdata.com/): this is a general data visualization blog, but author Nathan Yau produces the visualizations he creates in R.  There are some tutorials for subscribers as well.  He also has [books](http://flowingdata.com/books/) that include real data analysis examples that use R.

[`ggplot` Tutorials](https://github.com/minimaxir/ggplot2-web) by Max Woolf, an R notebook and code for making high quality visualizations in R
